# Notes

* I would have liked to tried harder at finidng a way to get a satellite iamge given coordinates and a radius. The satellite image seen above is just a static picture that I tried to get close to the overall area.  

* Robotics and Unmanned Systems (MEC_ENGR 459) also goes over path planning. We start out with Dijkstra, then A*, then RRT, but obstacles are included.
